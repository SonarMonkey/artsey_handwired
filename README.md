I had the hardest time compiling firmware for my handwired paintbrush based off the work of diagnosis over at Thingiverse (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4949264).
I flipped their design to a left hand oriented print (files under STLs folder), and got the case printed, but wasunable to find any working firmware for the device. 
The files in this repo will allow you to customize a working firmware for the device. I am not certain that it is 100% correct, but it does at least function.
